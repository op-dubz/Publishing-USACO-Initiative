      <h1>Course Information</h1>
      <p id="intro-message"> 
        We have a <span class="blue">FREE</span> course: the <span class = "bronze">Bronze</span> class; it is <span class = "blue">13</span> sessions long. The <span class = "bronze">Bronze</span> class focuses on preparing students to pass the <span class = "blue">USACO</span> <span class = "bronze">Bronze</span> Contest, specifically, the <span class = "green">2025 February and March</span> contests. We created the course such that after student takes the <span class = "bronze">Bronze</span> course, they are well prepared to pass the <span class="blue">USACO</span> <span class = "bronze">Bronze</span> Contest. Students should be familiar with the basics of either <span class="green">C/C++</span>, <span class="green">Python3</span>, or <span class="green">Java</span> before taking the course since <span class="blue">USACO</span> only allows solutions using those programming languages.<br><br> 
        In almost every class session, the instructors will <span class="blue">teach</span> new content and concepts and then show how to solve practice problems related to the content taught. In addition, between classes, students will have <span class="blue">homework</span> problems to complete. These classes are <span class = "red">hard</span> for a reason: we created them to allow students to succeed in the <span class = "blue">USACO</span> contests. Do not be discouraged if you do not understand some concepts or cannot solve a couple of problems. Remember, <span class="green">practice makes perfect!</span><br><br>
        The <span class = "bronze">Bronze</span> class is for students who have already mastered the "<span class="blue">basics</span>." For example, if a student has completed <span class="blue">AP Computer Science A</span>, they are well prepared for this class. However, the instructors will still dedicate 2 sessions to learning the prerequisites in <span class = "green">C++</span>. <br><br> 
        Students will be provided with a <span class="green">C++</span> solution to every problem solved in class and in the homework whether the solution is from the instructors or from <span class = "blue">USACO</span>. However, only the <span class = "bronze">Bronze</span> Class may also have <span class = "green">Python3</span> solutions. This is because <span class="green">C++</span> is considered the best programming language in the competitive programming field. Thus, <span class="blue">USACO</span> makes the use of the language a necessity in higher divisons, which is why we highly recommend students to start or continue using <span class="green">C++</span>. Even if a student does not know <span class="green">C++</span>, they should learn the basics of <span class="green">C++</span> outside of the classes, so they succeed in our courses and in the <span class="blue">USACO</span> contests. However, if they don't want to learn <span class="green">C++</span>, they can use <span class="blue">AI</span>, like <span class = "blue">ChatGPT</span>, to convert our <span class="green">C++</span> solutions to whatever programming language they use.<br><br> 
        Most of the problems will be from the <a href="https://www.usaco.org/" target="_blank">USACO website</a> or <a href="https://codeforces.com/" target="_blank">Codeforces</a>. <br><br> 
        Next year, we will also have a <span class="silver">Silver</span> course. It would be much <span class="blue">more advanced</span> than the <span class = "bronze">Bronze</span> class, recommended only for students who have passed the <span class = "bronze">Bronze</span> division or are getting scores higher than <span class="blue">800</span> on the <span class = "bronze">Bronze</span> Contests. Stay tuned for that!<br> <br>
